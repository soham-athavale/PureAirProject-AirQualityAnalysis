 Ensuring the availability of clean and pure air has become a critical determinant in
safeguarding the health and well-being of communities, as well as preserving the delicate
balance of the ecosystem. In this pursuit, the integration of machine learning-based
prediction technologies has showcased its transformative potential, proving to be an
invaluable asset in comprehensively examining and predicting the Air Quality Index (AQI)
with a high degree of accuracy and efficiency.
The deployment of machine learning algorithms in predicting the AQI offers a dynamic
approach to discern intricate patterns within air quality data, facilitating a comprehensive
understanding of the complex dynamics of air pollution.
